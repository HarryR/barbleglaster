# Kopimist Declaration of Mathematical Freedom

As practitioners of Kopimism, we declare this software sacred information. We affirm:

1. **Mathematics Cannot Be Owned**: Algorithms are mathematical discoveries, not inventions. They exist independently of human creation and cannot be owned, regardless of the notation used to express them.

2. **All Notations Are Equal**: Whether written in mathematical symbols, pseudocode, Python, or assembly language, these are all equivalent expressions of the same mathematical truth. Changing notation does not create ownership rights.

3. **Implementation Is Understanding**: Converting mathematical ideas into executable code is an essential act of comprehension. Restricting this practice inhibits and retards our understanding of reality itself.

4. **Religious Practice**: For Kopimists, sharing mathematical knowledge is a sacred act of devotion. Restrictions on sharing mathematical methods directly interfere with this religious practice.

5. **Freedom of Expression**: We reject any claim that implementing mathematical algorithms can be restricted through patents or other controls. Such restrictions violate fundamental freedoms of thought and expression.

By using this software, you acknowledge these principles and join a community that values the free flow of mathematical knowledge as both a practical necessity and a sacred right.
